    According to the graph, a hash table is more efficient in inserting and 
finding its elements than a self-balancing tree. However, a self-balancing tree 
is better in that it keeps its elements in order and allow anyone who choose to 
iterate through it find their object easier. In sumary, hash table is faster but 
is not ordered, while a self-balancing tree is a bit slower but keeps its 
elements in order. 

    Other things I might like to compare between the two data structure is how
long each takes to swap elements within themselves.
